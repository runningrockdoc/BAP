# BAP
Bader-Avizo-PerGeos (Automated data collection code for Avizo, PerGeos software, written in Python). RegAnalysis is the code which contains functions to plot best fit estimates, histograms, and compare best fit estimates and means from the datasheet produced by BAP code. These codes combined collect all data, produce all graphs, and perform all statistics, except for the melt volume orientation section, in Bader et al. 2023 (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023JB028065).
